    <h1>About Us</h1>
    <p>Welcome to GibJohn Tutoring, your premier online tutoring platform dedicated to helping students of all ages and skill levels achieve academic success.</p>

    <section>
        <h2>Our Story</h2>
        <p>GibJohn Tutoring was founded by John Gibson, a passionate educator with over a decade of teaching experience. John's journey in education began as a maths teacher in a public secondary school, where he witnessed firsthand the impact that one-on-one instruction can have on a student's academic trajectory. He saw how students who received individual attention and support were more likely to excel in their studies, develop a growth mindset, and pursue their passions with confidence.</p>
        <p>Inspired by this experience, John created GibJohn Tutoring to bring this same level of personalised instruction to students everywhere. Our online platform allows us to reach students from all over the world, providing them with access to expert tutors, interactive learning tools, and a supportive community that celebrates their successes and helps them overcome challenges.</p>
